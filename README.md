# Hi, I'm Alana 👋
I'm an attorney transitioning deeper into data and analytics.

By day, I work with contracts and legal frameworks.
By night, I quarrel with csv files and get creative in Tableau.


🌱 Off-Screen: 
Trying (and sometimes failing) to keep my houseplants alive.

This GitHub documents my learning journey; projects, experiments, mistakes, and progress:

## 📈 The "Work in Progress" Tracker


• **SQL & R:** Currently in the "why is this code not working?" phase of my journey. (Progress > Perfection).

## 🛠️ What's in my Backpack?
Tools I'm getting comfortable with. The more blue squares, the less I have to Google the basics:

• **Advanced Excel:** 🟦 🟦 🟦 ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ (I trust my formulas. Excel mostly agrees)

• **Tableau:** 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 ⬜️ ⬜️ (learning to make art...useful)

• **Legal Knowledge:** 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 🟦 (not omniscient, just very prepared)

• **SQL / R:** 🟦 ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ (I write SELECTs with confidence. JOINs require encouragement)

• **Power BI:** ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ ⬜️ (haven't even downloaded it yet)

## 🌱 Featured Project: The Houseplant Resilience Project

This was my first deep dive into data. I analyzed 49 houseplants to help a nursery reduce plant failure through better customer guidance.

• **The "Aha!" Moment:** Realizing that plant failure is rarely caused by one mistake. Instead, problems emerge from a breakdown across light, water, and routine, especially when expectations aren't clearly communicated.

• **The Lawyer Win:** Flagged toxic plants; safety first, lawsuits later!
